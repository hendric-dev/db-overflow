# DB Overflow

Fill Postgres tables with large amounts of generated data.

## Get Started

DB Overflow is designed as a command line interface. It's as easy as downloading it from the [Releases](https://github.com/hendric-dev/db-overflow/releases) page and run it from a terminal:

```sh
db-overflow --help
```

See the [ðŸ“š Documentation](https://hendric-dev.github.io/db-overflow/) for more information.
